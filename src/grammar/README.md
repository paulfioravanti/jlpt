# JLPT N1 Grammar

The files in this directory show the [HTML][]/[Stencil][] and [CSS][] code I
used to create my [Japanese Language Proficiency Test][] (JLPT) Level N1
**Grammar** flash cards using [Anki][].

The files are here to serve as a reference to anyone that cannot or does not
want to use the `JLPT N1 Grammar.apkg` [Anki Packaged Deck][] file included at
the root level of this repository. You will have a much easier time just
importing the packaged deck than re-creating this deck from scratch, so I
recommend importing if you are able to.

## Fields

In order for the code to work, the following named fields must exist in the
deck:

1. Example
2. Grammar Pattern
3. Grammar Pattern Meaning
4. Examples
5. Grammar Notes

![Grammar Fields][]

All the fields used the default options aside from the following fields:

- Grammar Pattern: enabled "Sort by this field in the browser" radio button
- Examples: checked "Remember last input when adding"
- Grammar Notes: checked "Remember last input when adding"
